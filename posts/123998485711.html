<h2>Nightwatch Background Story (October 2002)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>MAILC/2.4.23</b><br/>Message 3846 of 3898 sent.<br/>Processing message 3847&hellip;<br/><b>From:</b> admin@bmrf.mil</p><p><b>To: </b>***** CENSORED *****<br/><b>Message-ID:</b> BMRF 93.3847<br/><b>Requested-Security:</b> 65536-bit polymorphic single-use encryption key #4857384<br/></p><p>Gentlemen,<br/></p><p>As you are aware, approximately eight months ago I discovered an anomalous pattern of usage for the primary teleportation core. I have since determined that this was in fact unauthorized usage by an unfamiliar group of individuals (apparently known to my associates in the military as part of the &lsquo;Black Operations&rsquo; corps but unreferenced in any available military documentation). Obviously, this unauthorized usage is a grave problem in itself, as it is a gross violation of Policy 37X, which forbids the disclosure of this technology to any Terran nation or group until testing is complete and the documented social criteria have been met.</p><p>After a thorough examination of instrument readings taken over the past three months, I have determined that no less than two hundred fifteen unauthorized teleportations have occurred from the Lambda Teleportation Unit. These have varied in size from around two hundred pounds (most likely one adult male) to over thirty-five tons. The unidentified paramilitaries have apparently also made contact with the Xen aliens and the alien explorers under the command of the Nihilanth entity. While the exact nature of these encounters is unknown, contact with the Nihilanth group has abruptly ceased (leading me to believe that the contact has made a definite negative impression about Terrans on these aliens). As you know, the native Xen aliens (such as the crab-like and squid-like creatures) are not capable of communication and have repeatedly proven themselves to be hostile to all humanoid life.</p><p>I am deeply concerned by the number of distinct teleportation instances, and the comparatively large mass teleported. Also troubling is the evident implication that one of the trusted members of my staff is working against our organization and may already have compromised our operations on Xen. Infiltration to this degree leads me to suspect that these 'Black Ops&rsquo; to be closely related to the rival organization we are all too familar with. If this is the case, it would be likely be most unfortunate for us if whatever scheme they are conducting were to succeed.</p><p>However significant this breach of security may be, the sudden recall of all United States Marine Corps personnel stationed at Black Mesa for &ldquo;training purposes&rdquo; is immensely more dire. This withdrawal leaves us essentially defenseless in the event of trouble with these unidentified paramilitaries or, less likely, the Nihilanthi aliens on Xen. It has also reduced overall perimeter security by at least 70%, leaving only the Black Mesa Security and Military Security units to deal with any emergency situation. While both of these forces are comprised of the most highly qualified personnel available, they are hardly in a position to deal with any serious incident. I am very uncomfortable with this situation, especially in light of the recent threats to planetary security from the 'Race X&rsquo; aliens (whom I am sure will immediately proceed to exploit any vulnerability that presents itself). Fortunately, as you know, we have implemented very strict protocols to avoid any kind of cross-dimensional breach, although I am still somewhat apprehensive about the possibility of sabotage via one of the secondary antimatter-based systems, such as the antiparticle accelerator and antimass spectrometer.</p><p>I therefore request your approval for the observation and possible subtle assistance (in the unlikely event of a serious breach of security at the facility) of the following individuals predicted to have an extremely high Likelihood of Survival rating:</p><p>- Freeman, Dr. Gordon (Research Associate, Anomalous Materials Laboratory)<br/>- Shephard, Cpl. Adrian D. (Special Forces, United States Marine Corps)<br/>- Bennett, Dr. Walter A. (Research Associate, Biochemistry &amp; Bioengineering)<br/>- Archer, Sgt. William (Military Security, Sector C)<br/>- Coomer, Agent John P. (Coordinator, Tactical Operations Center)<br/>- Calhoun, Barney L. (Security, Pending Assignment)</p><p>Additionally, I would be most appreciative of any additional agents that may be dispatched to this facility. As the Administrator of the facility, I am constrained to observe arbitrary regulations imposed by the government of the United States and may not be able to secure the facility to the degree required to ensure its safety should our rivals provide the 'Black Ops&rsquo; with Level 7 government security clearance.</p><p>Sincerely,<br/><b>*** CORE SUBSYSTEM SEGMENTATION FAULT ***</b><br/>Active memory dumped to operations@bmrf/debug/0034.dmp<br/><b>Fault Trace:</b> exec:anom-mat@bmrf/monitors/samples(0)<br/></p></blockquote>
