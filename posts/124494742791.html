<h2>Nightwatch background story (June 2004)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From:</b> Jeremy Ridge &lt;jridge@internal.operations.admin&gt;<br/><b>To:</b> Lt. Col. Brandon Manning &lt;bmanning@internal.security.milsec&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID:</b> BMRF 92.9815<br/><b>Security: </b>Black Mesa Secure Transport Layer<br/><b>Subject:</b> Re: Lambda Sector</p><p>&gt; contained assault rifles and building materials. This is damned irregular<br/>&gt; and I haven&rsquo;t seen a single order in writing authorizing any of it. I can&rsquo;t<br/>&gt; even send in any people to keep all that stuff secure. What the hell is going<br/>&gt; on in those labs, and why isn&rsquo;t the Administrator ever CCed on any of the<br/>&gt; security memos? Almost seems like someone has a hidden agenda with<br/>&gt; whatever&rsquo;s going on in there and doesn&rsquo;t want the administrator to know</p><p>While I understand your concerns regarding the unusual procedure, the experiments taking place in the Lambda Complex are of the utmost importance and are being conducted at the highest level of classification. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t provide any further details on the nature of the projects being conducted, as you are undoubtedly aware given the area&rsquo;s enforced security clearance. I can categorically assure you that the research being conducted in the Lambda reactor complex does not pose the slightest threat to the facility&rsquo;s security, or to the safety of its personnel.</p><p>The Administrator is a busy man and does not need to be unnecessarily burdened with the daily operations of the project. He is well aware of its overall stated goals and is, of course, briefed by my staff and I on a regular basis about the overall progress of the experiment. The people running this facility are honest, hard-working individuals and I am unaware of any person operating with any sort of &ldquo;hidden agenda&rdquo; within the administration of this facility.</p><p>On a different note, I was finally able to obtain the service records for the recent arrivals to your detatchment. There was apparently a computer error at the Department of Defense that resulted in a transmission delay. The files are as follows:</p><p>[Attached file: MichaelCardin.rec]<br/>[Attached file: WilliamArcher.rec]<br/>[Attached file: MarkYockey.rec]<br/>[Attached file: AlanJobman.rec]</p><p>============================<br/><b>Jeremy Ridge</b><br/>Director of Operations<br/>Black Mesa Research Facility </p></blockquote>
