<h2>Nightwatch background story (March 2003)</h2>
<blockquote><p>From: Security Automailer &lt;internal:security@bmrf.infotech.automail&gt;<br/>To: Dr. Robert Burkes &lt;internal:rburkes@bmrf.robotics&gt;<br/>Message-ID: BMRF 93.3810<br/>Security: Default<br/>Subject: Briefing - Black Mesa Security: Part I</p><p>Welcome to to the Black Mesa Research Facility! This briefing is intended to familiarize you with all the basic security protocols and services that you will see during your employment at this facility. It has been sent to you automatically as a result of your account activation; if you have already passed a Security Procedures Introductory Course you may safely discard this document.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>PART ONE: PERSONNEL</p><p>The Black Mesa Security Force is comprised of two main sections: Military Security and Civilian Security. Each branch of the Security Force has different operating procedures, a different general function, and a different placement within the facility. A brief description of each branch is provided below for your convenience.</p><p>The primary function of the Military Security branch is to guard the base perimeter and prevent any unauthorized persons from entering the grounds. They are additionally charged with the security of most transportation checkpoints and some of the more high-risk and/or classified areas of the facility. They also respond to incidents where Civilian Security would be otherwise unable to contain the security breach. If you arrived at the facility via ground convoy, these are the people you probably saw at the gate when you first entered. Military Security personnel can be easily distinguished by their bullet-proof vests and generally heavier armament.</p><p>The Civilian Security branch maintains security within most of the facility itself and is primarily charged with enforcing security regulations &ndash; preventing personnel from entering high-security areas without clearance, ensuring safety procedures are properly followed in laboratories, and preventing potential corporate espionage. You will probably see many of them during the course of your work at the facility, and will quickly grow accustomed to their presence. Black Mesa Civilian Security personnel can be distinguished by their blue uniforms and ID cards.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Two additional messages will be sent to you within 24 hours, containing the second and third parts of this briefing (covering basic security protocols and non-security emergency services respectively).</p><p>============================<br/>Security Directorate<br/>Black Mesa Research Facility</p><p>&ldquo;Security is everyone&rsquo;s responsibility.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
