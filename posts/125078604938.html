<p>Thanks for tuning in for the Half-Life: Nightwatch retrospective.  One of the most gorgeous mods ever seen in the Goldsource engine.  Yes, it’s a shame it was never released but hopefully you still get to enjoy reminiscing a bit with me these last couple weeks.<br/></p><p><b>For the grand finale today, here are all the chapters of Nightwatch</b> (Goldsource version, of course) as they looked when the mod was cancelled, 9 years ago in July 2006. Enjoy!<br/></p>
