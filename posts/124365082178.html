<h2>Nightwatch background story (July 2003)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From:</b> Dr. Albert Wilde &lt;awilde@internal.research.anom-mat&gt;<br/><b>To:</b> Administrator &lt;admin@internal.management&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID: </b>BMRF 93.3844<br/><b>Security: </b>Default<br/><b>Subject:</b> Anti-Mass Spectrometry Concerns</p><p>I would again like to point out that the proposed experiment scheduled for the Anomalous Materials test chamber has repeatedly produced catastrophic results in simulation runs, and that the possibility of a resonance cascade scenario is still quite present. This is a completely unnecessary danger to our personnel. The experiment should clearly be delayed until proper modifications to the equipment can be made. The cross-dimensional nature of the crystal involved introduces an additional risk factor, one which may lead to unforseen consequences should the experiment be conducted.</p><p>Our equipment was not meant to perform these operations in the first place. While I am of course fully dedicated to our research effort, I would prefer not to witness a full-scale resonance cascade scenario first-hand. I implore you to make the right choice in this matter, despite my overly ambitious colleagues&rsquo; insistence on immediate results.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><b>Dr. Albert Wilde</b><br/>Black Mesa Anomalous Materials Laboratory </p></blockquote>
