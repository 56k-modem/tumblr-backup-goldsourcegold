<h2>Nightwatch background story (March 2003)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From:</b> Administrator &lt;admin@mil/bases.bmrf.management&gt;<br/><b>To:</b> Dr. Arthur Jones &lt;ajones@gov/agencies.nrc.inspection&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID:</b> BMRF 93.3814<br/><b>Requested-Security: </b>Department of Defense (Revised Cyan Book)<br/><b>Subject:</b> Re: Lambda Reactor</p><p>&gt; From: Dr. Arthur Jones &lt;ajones@gov/agencies.nrc.inspection&gt;<br/>&gt; To: Administrator &lt;admin@mil/bases.bmrf.management&gt;<br/>&gt; Message-ID: NRC 1920.4455<br/>&gt; Security: Department of Defense (Revised Cyan Book)<br/>&gt; Subject: Lambda Reactor<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I&rsquo;m pleased to say that the Lambda Reactor Complex has once<br/>&gt; again passed the bi-annual inspection with flying colors. I<br/>&gt; must congratulate you on your exceptional safety record and<br/>&gt; quick, decisive response to the few incidents that did<br/>&gt; occur.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to know why Mr. Victors was denied access to<br/>&gt; the upper Level A area of the reactor, though &ndash; I know<br/>&gt; that Black Mesa isn&rsquo;t exactly a public tourist attraction,<br/>&gt; but what could be so important that you&rsquo;d jeopardize your<br/>&gt; inspection rating?</p><p>Mr. Victors was not denied access to the tip of the reactor for security reasons; there was an unfortunate accident during routine reactor maintenance resulting in a spill of hazardous chemicals. There was no damage to the reactor itself, it was simply dangerous for people to enter the area without respirators. If Mr. Victors would care to return to the facility after we have completed a clean-up, I&rsquo;m sure he will be more than satisfied with our reactor safety precautions. Black Mesa is a safe, clean, hazard-free working environment. </p></blockquote>
