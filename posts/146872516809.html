This is my entry for <b>Ragemap 2016</b>. However, due the current issues with 
optimization discovered on the merged maps a couple of days ago, <b>is 
going to be delayed</b>, so I decided to <b>release my part for the public</b> 
meanwhile. <br/></p>
<p>I’m playing with godmode as the Ragemaps are designed to be 
played up to 10 players at the same time, so it’s very hard (almost 
impossible) to survive alone. The exit texture seen at the end was to 
indicate where the next mapper had to start his/her zone (same with the 
room that has the Generator Access texture, as a way to reach my room 
from the previous zone).<br/><br/>Created under <b>four hours</b>, and with 
<i>custom content</i> as the rules says (<b>Blueshift</b> textures and <b>Decay</b> models), 
my zone are divided into two parts:</p>
<p>-The first part is obviously inspirated on the 
prototype teleporter featured at the end of <i>Half-Life: Blueshift</i>, where 
you must hold during 300 seconds the place until the machine goes full 
power.</p>
<p>-The second part is based on the cut chapter <i>Hangar</i> from <i>
Decay</i>, where you must seek two security cards in order to open the 
gates.</p>
<p>
The
 pack includes both the RMF, a compiled BSP that can be played, and the 
Decay models. <b>You can use the brushwork on your maps, as long as I 
appear somewhere at the credits.</b></p>

<p><br/>My zone features new entities that come with <b>Sven Co-op 
5.0</b>, like trigger_numericdisplay (the countdown), or env_sentence (the 
custom and <b>LOUD</b> VOX sentences, as there are no volume settings). <b>Bear 
this in mind if you want to use this RMF in another game/mod</b>. <br/></p>
