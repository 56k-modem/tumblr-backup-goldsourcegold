<h2>Nightwatch Background Story (December 2002) [revision of previous story snippet]</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From: </b>Administrator &lt;admin@mil/bases.bmrf.management&gt;<br/><b>To: </b>Encrypted Recipient Address &lt;a23c80b93ca53af0&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID: </b>BMRF 93.3847<br/><b>Requested-Security:</b> 65536 bit polymorphic single-use encryption key #4857384</p><p>Gentlemen,</p><p>It has come to my attention that a group of individuals apparently known to the military as part of the &lsquo;Black Operations&rsquo; corps (but unreferenced in any military documentation available) has been covertly making use of the experimental teleportation technology we have recently developed here at Black Mesa. As you know, policy 37X forbids use of this technology by any nation or group until testing is complete and certain social conditions have been met; this has created a situation I am very uncomfortable with, especially in light of the recent threats to planetary security from the 'Race X&rsquo; aliens, whom I am sure will immediately proceed to exploit any vulnerability that presents itself.</p><p>After a thorough examination of instrument readings taken over the past three months, I have determined that no less than two hundred and fifteen unauthorized teleportations have occurred from the Lambda Teleportation Unit. These have varied in size from around two hundred pounds (most likely one adult male) to over fifteen tons. They have apparently also made contact with the border world wildlife and the alien civilization under the command of the Nihilanth entity. While the exact nature of these encounters is unknown, contact with the Nihilanth group has abruptly ceased, leading me to believe that the contact has made a definite negative impression about Terrans on these aliens. As you know, the greater part of the native Xen alien population (such as the crab-like and squid-like creatures) is not capable of communication, and its member species have repeatedly proven themselves to be hostile to all humanoid life.</p><p>I have also found numerous irregularities with the staffing reports from Black Mesa Weapons Research (BMWR), as well as numerous indications of additional teleportation from that facility, which troubles me greatly. Although we are working on measures to deal with a Resonance Cascade (RC) scenario here at Black Mesa (we currently have a working suppression system on the primary teleportation unit and may include one in the future for the antimass spectrometer in the Anomalous Materials laboratory due to its mechanical similarity to the teleportation technology), there are no such measures in place at the Weapons Research facility and any such cascade would be disastrous.</p><p>I believe these forces to be closely related to the rival organization we are all too familiar with. If this is the case, it would be most unfortunate if whatever experiments they are conducting were to succeed. I therefore request your approval for the observation and possible subtle assistance (in the unlikely event of a serious breach of security at the facility) of the following individuals predicted to have an extremely high likelihood of survival:</p><p>- Freeman, Dr. Gordon (Research Associate, Anomalous Materials Laboratory)<br/>- Shephard, Cpl. Adrian D. (Special Forces, United States Marine Corps)<br/>- Bennett, Dr. Walter A. (Research Associate, Biochemistry &amp; Bioengineering)<br/>- Archer, Sgt. William (Military Security, Sector C)<br/>- Coomer, Agent John P. (Coordinator, Tactical Operations Center)<br/>- Calhoun, Barney L. (Security, Pending Assignment)<br/>Additionally, I would be most appreciative of any additional agents that may be dispatched to this facility. As the Administrator of the facility, I am constrained to observe arbitrary regulations imposed by the government of the United States and may not be able to secure the facility to the degree required to ensure its safety should our rivals provide the 'Black Ops&rsquo; with Level 7 government security clearance, which I am sure they can effortlessly obtain through their contacts within the government security infrastructure.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p><b>*** GENERAL PROTECTION FAULT ***</b><br/>Corruption begins at address 0x023028203B42903F.<br/>Fault Trace: samples@bmrf.anom-mat/security/monitors</p><p><b>*** KERNEL FAILURE ***</b><br/>Automatic server reboot will occur in 30 seconds.<br/>Active memory dumped to 0034.dmp@bmrf.operations/dev/debug</p></blockquote>
