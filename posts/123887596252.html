<h2>Early Nightwatch background story (August 2002)</h2>
<blockquote><p>Date: Irrelevant<br/>Time: 8:47 AM Mountain Standard Time<br/>Location: Black Mesa Research Facility, Sector D Facility Integrity Control<br/>Subject: William Archer, BMRF Military Security Force</p><p>During
 the day, Black Mesa is a hub of scientific, technological, and personal
 achievements. If one were to take a quick stroll through one of the 
many employee lounges throughout the facility, he would find scientists 
eagerly bubbling with information about all the latest non-classified 
tests he has been focusing on; they could easily be confused for small 
enthusiastic children if not for the crinkles under their eyes and 
tinges of grey forming on what hair (if any) they have left. Keeping a 
watchful eye over the research team is a powerful tag-team of Black Mesa
 Security and an on-site United States military facility.</p><p>During 
the nights, however, a third protective force emerges. Black Mesa 
Military Security serves as a nighttime security force representing the 
unholy union between BMS and the Marines. More benevolent than the 
trigger-happy Marines, but yet better trained with standard-issue 
military arms than the standard security force, MilSec officers 
effectively place the facility under lockdown at night. Only operating 
between Red Shift and Blue Shift, in what has come to be known as Black 
Shift, MilSec officers are the mostly invisible skeleton crew that holds
 the facility in place.</p><p>So the cycle goes on and on &ndash; the 
facility buzzes with activity during the day and sleeps in shadowed 
silence broken only by the footsteps of the MilSec officers who slowly 
patrol each and every perimeter.</p><p>That is, until a week ago.</p><p>The
 science team has become more apprehensive. Tension is on the rise, and 
BMS officers have been called in three times to subdue inter-scientist 
scuffles. The Marines have been performing more combat maneuvers than 
usual, and a surprising number of air insertion drills. Standard 
security officers find their clearance reduced, and even MS officers are
 finding certain areas in a lockdown that pre-empts even their 
authority. Unprecedented technical repairs and tweaks were in progress 
throughout the entire facility.</p><p>William Archer, assigned to Sector
 D Facility Integrity Control and MilSec Squad 4, normally wakes up to 
the setting sun burning harsh orange rays through his blinds. Yesterday 
afternoon, he was awakened by the sound of aircraft. He walked to the 
window and split a couple slats of the blinds. A most unusual sight fell
 before him &ndash; at least 10 Osprey aircraft, seemingly loaded almost to 
the point of overflow with Marines, slowly were gliding overhead. 
Escorting the landing aircraft was what seemed to be the facility&rsquo;s 
entire fleet of attack helicopters. As the pulse of the rotor aircraft 
began to fade, a second sound grew in the background. The roar of 
afterburners shook the dormitory structure as a sharp delta of what 
looked like F-16 Falcons screamed into view, quickly overtaking the 
slower rotor aircraft. As he checked into his post later that night, he 
noticed a scrawled message taped to the armory door - &ldquo;Military moved 
off-site. Squad 3 - extended hours. Take Blue Shift to 12:00 AM.&rdquo; He 
almost overlooked the footnote: &ldquo;All squads - Maintain full loadout. 
Shoot on sight authority in Sector C.&rdquo;</p><p>It turned out that the 
entire Black Mesa Marine presence had been moved off-facility. Even the 
fighter aircraft had been sent airborne, which was becoming a more and 
more uncommon sight as time went on. There was no question, something 
big was going down.</p><p>Now, as Black Shift gives way to Blue Shift 
and MS officers step in to fill the mysterious void left by the sudden 
departure of the marine presence, all hell is breaking loose. Computers 
are failing, lifts are freezing, and scientists are just downright 
pissed off. As Archer makes his way to the tram system to try to forget 
the sudden apprehension, another young member of the Black Mesa staff is
 getting a late start to his day as his tram lumbers towards Sector C&hellip;</p><p>&ldquo;The current time is 8:47 AM. Current topside temperature is 98 degrees&hellip;&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
