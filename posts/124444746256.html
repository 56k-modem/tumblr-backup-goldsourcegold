<h2>Nightwatch background story (November 2003)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From: </b>Personnel Automailer &lt;personnel@internal.infotech.automail&gt;<br/><b>To: </b>Dr. Robert Burkes &lt;rburkes@internal.research.robotics&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID: </b>BMRF 93.3809<br/><b>Security: </b>Default<br/><b>Subject:</b> Briefing - Welcome to Black Mesa!</p><p>Welcome to the Black Mesa Research Facility! This document is intended to help familiarize you with the new environment you will be working in during your employment. It has been sent to you automatically as a result of your account activation; if you have already attended a Personnel, Facilities and Transportation Introductory Course you may safely discard this document.</p><p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p><p>Whether you arrived at Black Mesa by plane, helicopter or ground convoy, you have undoubtedly been surprised by the sheer size and expansiveness of the Black Mesa Research Facility. And that&rsquo;s just the above-ground portion! Although the exact size and personnel complement of the facility is classified for security reasons, you should know that the Black Mesa complex is comparable in size and population to a small city. As a result, you may notice certain similarities between Black Mesa and a normal civilian community &ndash; dedicated security, fire, and medical teams, a variety of dining establishments, and even an extensive public transit system. On the other hand, it does have several characteristics a civilian community would ordinarily not have &ndash; additional regulations, security checkpoints, access control, extensive laboratory complexes, and a digitized communications system. For this reason, we strongly encourage you to attend a Personnel, Facilities and Transportation Introductory Course to get to know the basic areas and services provided at the Facility, or at least consult the Black Mesa Services Handbook, available from the Personnel Department upon request.</p><p>You might also wish to familiarize yourself with the basic security regulations in effect here at Black Mesa. The Security Automailer will shortly be dispatching a series of messages to you to introduce the Security infrastructure and basic regulations. If you do not receive this message within 24 hours, please notify &lt;helpdesk@internal.infotech&gt;.</p><p>We hope you find your employment at the facility an enjoyable and productive experience, and look forward to having you on the team.</p><p>============================<br/><b>Personnel Directorate</b><br/>Black Mesa Research Facility </p></blockquote>
