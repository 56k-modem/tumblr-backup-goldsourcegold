<h2>Nightwatch background story (July 2004)</h2>
<blockquote><p><b>From: </b>Dr. Grace Neal &lt;gneal@internal.research.envlabs&gt;<br/><b>To: </b>Anderson Peake &lt;apeake@internal.facilities.systems&gt;<br/><b>Message-ID:</b> BMRF 92.9829<br/><b>Security:</b> Black Mesa Standard<br/><b>Subject:</b> Security System Issues</p><p>Andy, I know it violates Security&rsquo;s almighty procedures, but could you please send someone down to fix the turrets? There&rsquo;s some kind of bug in the firmware that makes them go berserk whenever the connection to the Operations router drops or someone reboots the Security server. My staff won&rsquo;t even go near the things now, and it&rsquo;s starting to interfere with our research. It&rsquo;s a miracle no one&rsquo;s been killed yet, and I&rsquo;m afraid sooner or later somebody&rsquo;s going to get their leg blown off. Even the doors are giving us trouble sometimes &ndash; the retinal scanners keep mismatching patterns and locking people out of the observation areas.</p><p>We don&rsquo;t even have any animals in the domes anymore &ndash; all the tests right now are being conducted on plants, and I somehow doubt that carnegiea gigantea is going to walk over and assault my control room. The only potentially dangerous things we&rsquo;ve got left are those fish the High Security people brought us (the strange ones from the Challenger Deep), and it&rsquo;s not like they&rsquo;re going to sprout legs and walk into the corridors. I&rsquo;d very much prefer one of those Military Security people around in case someone falls into the water dome &ndash; you know, to shoot at the fish or something. Even when Genetics was injecting that transgenic stuff into the cows there still wasn&rsquo;t much risk of anything happening, but you know how Security is.</p><p>Anyway, give me a call when you get this. My new extension is 68374.</p><p>============================<br/><b>Dr. Grace Neal</b><br/>Head Researcher<br/>Black Mesa Environment Laboratory </p></blockquote>
