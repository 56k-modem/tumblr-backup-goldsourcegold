<h2>Nightwatch story: the ending</h2>
<p>Sourced from tweets in August 2014 by Andrew Weldon, Nightwatch founder and project director:</p><blockquote><p>&hellip;the ending of Pacific Rim is the planned ending of Nightwatch. </p><p>In the Nightwatch story, Xen was one of many &ldquo;border worlds&rdquo; that directly linked portals, hence Black Mesa portals arriving there. </p><p> The resonance cascade at Black Mesa turned Earth into a portal beacon, ripping life from Xen, and opening a door to anyone with portal tech.</p><p> This is why Race X from Op4 showed up, as well as scouts from a new enemy in Nightwatch, who had clashed with Black Ops forces in Xen.</p><p> In Nightwatch, Black Ops had established outposts in Xen to mine the then-intact planet core, eventually destabilizing and destroying it. </p><p> So, the Black Mesa survivors dodged the Op4 nuke by jumping to a Black Ops outpost in Xen, then sent a nuke through a portal to the new enemy&rsquo;s world.</p><p>Then the player character and colleague Lt. Alexis Robinson were whisked away by the G-Man, who monologued about deus ex machinas&hellip;</p><p> &hellip;and sent you back to Earth to prepare for the war that was about to come.<br/></p></blockquote><p>Coming next: a series of unreleased screenshots from the final chapter of Nightwatch!</p>
